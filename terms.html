          <br><br>
          Then at the beginning of the next accounting period Affiliate would have the following information about promoted brands:
          <br><br>
          Brand 1 | NGR (3,000) EUR, where 10,000 EUR were compensated and was not carried overBrand 2 | NGR 0 EUR, as usual at the beginning of the accounting periodBrand 3 | NGR 0 EUR, where 3,000 EUR were compensated and was not carried over
          <br><br>
          Moreover, as mentioned above, payouts for Brands do NOT sums. E.g. if Affiliate has a revenue share 50% terms, he would gain:0 EUR for Brand 1;2,000 EUR (4000 * 50% = 2000) for Brand 2;0 EUR for Brand 3.

          <span>9.3. Commission</span> Upon termination of the Affiliate Agreement for any reason, all Commission relating to any New Customers directed to Company during the term shall not be payable to the Affiliate as from the date of termination.

          <br>
          <span>10.3 Non-Waiver</span> Our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of the Affiliate Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of the Affiliate Agreement.

          <br>
          <span>10.5 Force Majeure</span> Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under the Affiliate Agreement if such delay or failure arises from a cause beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to labour disputes, strikes, industrial disturbances, acts of God, acts of terrorism, floods, lightning, utility or communications failures, earthquakes or other casualty. If such event occurs, the non-performing Party is excused from whatever performance is prevented by the event to the extent prevented provided that if the force majeure event subsists for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days then either Party may terminate the Affiliate Agreement with immediate effect by providing a written notice.
          <br>
          <span>10.6 Assignability</span> You may not assign the Affiliate Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.
          <br>
          <span>10.7 Severability</span> If any provision of the Affiliate Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of the Affiliate Agreement or any provision hereof.
          <br>
          <span>10.8 English language</span> The Affiliate Agreement was first drafted in English. Should there be any conflict or discrepancy between the English language version and any other language, the English version shall prevail.
          <br>
          <span>10.9 Modification of Terms & Conditions</span> We may modify any of the terms and conditions contained in the Affiliate Agreement or replace it at any time and in our sole discretion by posting a change notice or a new agreement on our site. Modifications may include, for example, changes in the scope of available Commissions and Affiliate Program rules.
          If any modification is unacceptable to you, your need to terminate the Affiliate Agreement. Your continued participation in our Affiliate Program following our posting of a change notice or new agreement will constitute binding acceptance of the modification or of the new agreement.
